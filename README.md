# SchemaGenerator
A simple schema generator using Symfony (DBAL).

To use this project, you need to have composer installed and requires few dependencies.

1. Clone this repository: `https://github.com/prunepal333/SchemaGenerator`
2. Get into the directory: `cd SchemaGenerator`
3. Run: `composer install`
4. Upon successful installation, run `composer serve`
This will trigger a php development server at localhost:9000.
If that port is already bound to other process, you need to manually change the port defined in composer.json file.
